# Sample Crypto Website
This is a simple template I created for a cryptocurrency token website, with various branding elements such as:
- Logo with Name
- Description/Catchphrase
- Tokenomics Section
- Social Media/Chart/Contract Address Section
- Rubic Widget for easy purchasing

It's all responsive and supports future expansion like more social media options, more website sections (Whitepaper, Listings, etc) and can easily be tailored toward a specific coin and/or color palette.
